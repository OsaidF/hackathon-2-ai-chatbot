# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo AI Chatbot with Natural Language Interface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Result**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

The specification successfully demonstrates:
1. User-focused language throughout (no technical jargon about frameworks, databases, or APIs)
2. Three prioritized, independently testable user stories covering core functionality
3. Comprehensive edge case analysis (10 scenarios identified)
4. All 20 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
5. All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (focus on user experience metrics)
6. Clear scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" section
7. Well-documented assumptions providing context for implementation decisions

**Specification Quality Assessment**:
- Content Quality: EXCELLENT - Clear focus on user needs, no implementation leakage
- Requirement Completeness: COMPLETE - All requirements testable, no clarifications needed
- Feature Readiness: READY - Can proceed directly to `/sp.plan`

**Recommendation**: Specification is ready for planning phase. No clarifications or amendments required.
